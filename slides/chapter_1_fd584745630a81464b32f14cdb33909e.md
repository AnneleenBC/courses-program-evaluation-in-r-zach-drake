Wow! So far you have found a real problem that our program might be able to address. We also determined the target group that is most at risk. However, finding these things is not enough on its own. In the last part of this lesson, we are going to summarize the differences between our target group and comparison groups and create a visualization that will be easy for program leadership to understand.

## Creating a Comparison Group

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "497e89a5cd"
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
How is the target group different? {{1}}
- Age {{2}}
- Sex {{3}}
- Education {{4}}
- Geography{{5}}
- Behaviors {{6}}
- Opinions {{7}}
- Many more! {{8}}

`@script`
A good program evaluation doesn't just identify or confirm the target of the program. The evaluation also must analyze and consider the differences between the target groups and the non-target groups in a population. Essentially we are asking the question: "How is our target group different?". {{1}} 

There might be many ways in which our target group is different from our comparison group. It is your job as the data scientist to think through the most important and relevant differences that are applicable to the goals of the program. Some common differences to consider are Age {{2}}, Sex {{3}}, Education {{4}}, and Geography {{5}}. However with many programs you might also need to consider the differences in Behaviors {{6}} or maybe even Opinions {{7}}. This list is in no way exhaustive.
