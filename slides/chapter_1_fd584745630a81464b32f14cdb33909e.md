Wow! So far you have found a real problem that our program might be able to address. We also determined the target group that is most at risk. However, finding these things is not enough on its own. In the last part of this lesson, we are going to summarize the differences between our target group and comparison groups and create a visualization that will be easy for program leadership to understand.

## Creating a Comparison Group

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "497e89a5cd"
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
How is the target group different? {{1}}
- Age {{2}}
- Sex {{3}}
- Education {{4}}
- Geography{{5}}
- Behaviors {{6}}
- Opinions {{7}}
- Many more! {{8}}


`@script`
A good program evaluation doesn't just identify or confirm the target of the program. The evaluation also must analyze and consider the differences between the target groups and the non-target groups in a population. Essentially we are asking the question: "How is our target group different?". {{1}} 

There might be many ways our target group might be different from our comparison groups. Some common differences to consider are Age {{2}}, Sex {{3}}, Education {{4}}, and Geography {{5}}. However with many programs you might also need to consider the differences in Behaviors {{6}} or maybe even Opinions {{7}}. This list is in no way exhaustive. As a data scientist you will need to think carefully about what which group differences are important for your study.

## Comparing Groups in R

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "489e2913fc"
```

`@part1`
_Basic_: 
Females vs Males {{1}}
_Better_: 
Low Wage Middle Aged Females
Middle Wage Middle Aged Females
High Wage Middle Aged Females
Low Wage Middle Aged Females {{2}}


`@part2`
``` {{3}}
data %>%
	group_by(sex, age, education) %>%
    summarise_all(funs(mean))
```


`@script`
When reporting an evaluation,you need to summarize the differences between groups as concisely as possible.This will usually mean creating informative names for each group. For instance, if your target group is "females", then logically your comparison group will be “males". However a target group can be more complex, for instance all females, ages 30 to 55, with an income below $15,000 per year. In this case, it is better to name this group something like “Low Wage Middle Aged Females”. The comparison groups might be be "Middle Wage Middle Aged Females", "High Wage Middle Aged Females", "Low Wage Middle Aged Females" and so on. 

Here we have some R code that calculates summaries by group. We group our data by sex, age, and education. Then we use the summarize_all command to calculate the means for each column.
